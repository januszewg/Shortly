The config file has everything about database and it has the url base, you should change that depends where you at, for example: if you are in a domain and you are in the main foler you just have to change '/shortly/' to '/', and that should work perfectly.

'/shortly/' is the folder where the files are, so if you put the files inside a  'example' folder, you have to go and change the config file in line #6 from '/shortly/' folder name, to  '/example/' folder name.

All files here should go inside a folder or if you are in a domain just drop their inside the server and do not
forget to change the config file as I explain before
